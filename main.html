	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		My motivation to become a software developer stems from my passion for problem-solving and innovation. I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to transform ideas into tangible solutions that can impact the world. Writing code allows me to express my creativity while also tackling complex challenges. I am inspired by the opportunity to create tools and applications that improve lives, streamline processes, and make information more accessible. Becoming a developer is my way of contributing to an ever-evolving digital landscape and continuously learning in a field that never stands still.
